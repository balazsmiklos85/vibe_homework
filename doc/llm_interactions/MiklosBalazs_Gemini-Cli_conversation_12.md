> I have a small Hello World application, that I'd like to turn into an order handling microservice. Let's start by adding an endpoint   │

Okay, I will turn your "Hello World" application into a microservice for handling orders. I'll add endpoints to create and retrieve an order.


  Here's the plan:


   1. Domain Layer: I'll define the Order object and the necessary repository and port interfaces.
   2. Application Layer: I'll create an OrderService to implement the business logic.
   3. Infrastructure Layer: I'll set up the REST endpoints (/orders), the database entity, and the repository implementation using Panache.


  I will now create the necessary files and directories.

**WriteFile** `Writing to ...omain/homework/hello/domain/Order.java`

> This project utilizes the Hexagonal Architecture. Entity classes are not supposed to go to the domain module.

You are absolutely right. In Hexagonal Architecture, persistence-specific details like JPA entities belong in the infrastructure layer, not
  the core domain.

  My plan was to place:


   * The pure domain object Order (a Java record with no annotations) in the domain module.
   * The JPA-annotated OrderEntity class in the infrastructure module.


  This keeps the domain clean of persistence concerns.


  It seems you cancelled the file creation. Would you like me to proceed with creating the files with this structure?

> Yes

I've created the files. Now, I'll add dependencies to the build.gradle files. The application module needs lombok, and infrastructure
  requires quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache, quarkus-jdbc-h2, lombok, and mapstruct. The root build.gradle needs the mapstruct plugin. I'll start
  by examining the infrastructure build.gradle.

**ReadFile** `infrastructure/build.gradle`

Okay, I see the dependencies in infrastructure/build.gradle. I will add the mapstruct dependency and processor. I'll also add lombok.

**Edit** `infrastructure/build.gradle: dpendencies {... => dependencies {...`

Now I'll add lombok to the application module's build.gradle.

**ReadFile** `application/build.gradle`

Okay, I'll add lombok to application/build.gradle.

**Edit** `application/build.gradle: dpendencies {... => dependencies {...`

Now I'll add the mapstruct plugin to the root build.gradle.

**ReadFile** `build.gradle`
