For Quarkus to correctly resolve versions for all its dependencies, the `enforcedPlatform` (Quarkus BOM) needs to be applied in the `dependencies` block of *every* module that declares Quarkus dependencies.

Could you please add the `enforcedPlatform` line to the `dependencies` block of your *root* `build.gradle` file?

> [Model:] That's a very good alternative approach, and often a cleaner way to manage dependencies in a multi-module project!

If your root project is not intended to be a Quarkus application itself, and its purpose is mainly to orchestrate submodules, then it makes sense to remove direct Quarkus dependencies from its `dependencies` block.

In that case, you would need to ensure that all the Quarkus dependencies you listed (like `quarkus-arc`, `quarkus-jdbc-h2`, `quarkus-hibernate-validator`, `quarkus-junit5`, `rest-assured`) are declared in the `dependencies` block of the module that *is* your Quarkus application.

Based on our previous conversation, it seems like your `infrastructure` module is intended to be the Quarkus application, as it contains `quarkus-resteasy-reactive` and you've tried applying the `io.quarkus` plugin there.

So, yes, you can remove those Quarkus dependencies from your root `build.gradle`. If you do, please make sure to add them to the `dependencies` block of your `infrastructure/build.gradle` file, alongside the `enforcedPlatform` declaration that is already there.

Would you like to try that?

Is your *root* project intended to be a Quarkus application itself, or is it primarily a parent project that orchestrates your submodules (`domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`)?

If your root project is only meant to orchestrate submodules and not be a Quarkus application itself, then the `id 'io.quarkus'` plugin should *not* be applied in the root `build.gradle` file. It should only be applied in the `infrastructure/build.gradle` file.

This error, specifically the missing version (the colon at the end of `quarkus-resteasy-reactive:`), almost always means that the Quarkus Bill of Materials (BOM) is not being correctly applied or its version is not being picked up for that specific dependency.

> [Model:] That's a very reasonable question to ask when you've tried so many common solutions!

I can confirm that `io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive` *does* exist and is a standard Quarkus extension. For example, it's available on Maven Central for Quarkus 3.24.2. So, the dependency itself is not the problem.

Since the error persists despite applying the BOM, configuring repositories, and refreshing dependencies, let's check another common source of build issues: your Gradle version.

What version of Gradle are you using? You can find this by running `gradle -v` in your terminal.

> [User:] 8.14.3

`<<< Sent 2025-07-06T15:42:12.090548 <<<`

The error `Could not find io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive:.` (with the missing version) still points to the Quarkus Bill of Materials (BOM) not being correctly applied or its version not being picked up for this specific dependency.

You mentioned `implementation enforcedPlatform("${quarkusPlatformGroupId}:${quarkusPlatformArtifactId}:${quarkusPlatformVersion}")` is in your `infrastructure/build.gradle`.

Could you please provide the *exact* line of this `enforcedPlatform` declaration from your `infrastructure/build.gradle` file? I want to see if there are any subtle differences or typos in how it's written.

> [Model:] You're right, we have discussed this before. My apologies for asking again.

The reason I'm asking to re-confirm the `plugins` block in `infrastructure/build.gradle` is because the `io.quarkus` plugin is absolutely critical for Quarkus to correctly resolve its dependencies using the BOM. If there's any subtle issue with how it's applied, or if it's not applied at the very top of the file, it can lead to the exact "missing version" error we're seeing.

Given that we've exhausted many other common causes, I want to be absolutely certain about this fundamental configuration.

Could you please provide the *exact* contents of the `plugins` block from your `infrastructure/build.gradle` file one more time?

> [Model:] I understand you've confirmed the plugin is there.

Sometimes, the *position* of the `plugins` block within the `build.gradle` file can be critical for how Gradle applies them.

Is the `plugins` block the *very first* block in your `infrastructure/build.gradle` file, before any other configurations like `repositories`, `dependencies`, or `java-library` specific settings?

Now, let's focus on the `dependencies` block within `infrastructure/build.gradle`. You mentioned the order starts with `enforcedPlatform`, then `:domain`, `:application`, etc.

Is the `enforcedPlatform` line the *very first* line inside your `dependencies { ... }` block, before any other `implementation` or `api` declarations?

Could you please provide the *exact* lines from your `gradle.properties` file where `quarkusPlatformGroupId`, `quarkusPlatformArtifactId`, and `quarkusPlatformVersion` are defined? Please copy and paste them directly if possible, to ensure there are no hidden characters or subtle typos.

The error `Could not find io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive:.` (with the missing version) is still the core issue.

You mentioned you have both `implementation 'io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive'` and `implementation 'io.quarkus:quarkus-rest'` in your `infrastructure/build.gradle` file.

For Quarkus 3.x (like 3.24.2), the primary REST extension is `quarkus-rest`. The `quarkus-resteasy-reactive` artifact was primarily used in Quarkus 2.x and might be causing a conflict or an unexpected resolution path when both are present, especially if one is a compatibility layer.

Could you please try removing the line `implementation 'io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive'` from your `infrastructure/build.gradle` file, leaving only `implementation 'io.quarkus:quarkus-rest'`?

Then, try building your application again and let me know the exact error message.
