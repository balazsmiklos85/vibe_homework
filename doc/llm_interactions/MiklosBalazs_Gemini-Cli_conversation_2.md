> This will be the root directory of my new project. I already have Java 21, Gradle and Quarkus installed on the system. Create a new Quarkus microservice. Initially implement just a "Hello World". Use Hexagonal Architecture to organize the code.

Shell quarkus create app hu.vibe.homework:hello-service --gradle --java=21 (This command will create a new Quarkus project named 'h…

`quarkus create app hu.vibe.homework:hello-service --gradle --java=21`

The quarkus command was not found. I'll try to use jbang to run the Quarkus CLI, assuming it's available on your system.

## 10:26

> Apparently I forgot to add it to the path after installation. It should be in `~/.sdkman/candidates/quarkus/current/bin`. Check if that's right, add it to the `PATH` and then use it.

Okay, I'll check for the Quarkus executable at ~/.sdkman/candidates/quarkus/current/bin, add it to the PATH, and then proceed with creating the microservice.

## 10:29

> I accidentally cancelled the last operation, please continue.

Of course. I will continue by checking for the Quarkus executable at the path you provided.

**Shell** `ls -l ~/.sdkman/candidates/quarkus/current/bin/quarkus` (Checking for the Quarkus executable at the specified path.)

Great, the quarkus executable is right where you said it would be. I'll add it to the PATH for this session and then create the microservice.

**Shell** `export PATH="$HOME/.sdkman/candidates/quarkus/current/bin:$PATH" && quarkus create app hu.vibe.homework:hello-service --gradl`…

The hello-service microservice has been created. Now, I'll restructure the project to follow the Hexagonal Architecture.

I will create the following directories:
- hello-service/src/main/java/hu/vibe/homework/hello/domain
- hello-service/src/main/java/hu/vibe/homework/hello/application
- hello-service/src/main/java/hu/vibe/homework/hello/infrastructure

Then, I'll move the generated GreetingResource.java to the infrastructure layer.

**Shell** `mkdir -p hello-service/src/main/java/hu/vibe/homework/hello/domain &&` …

Now that the directory structure is in place, I need to update the package declaration in GreetingResource.java to reflect its new location. I'll also move the logic to a dedicated service in the application layer and define a port in the domain layer.

First, I'll read the content of GreetingResource.java.

**ReadFile** `...hello-service//GreetingResource.java`

Okay, I will now update the GreetingResource.java file. I'll change the package, inject a GreetingService and delegate the "hello" logic to it.

**Edit** `...hello-service//GreetingResource.java: package hu.vibe.homework;... => package hu.vibe.homework.hello...` ←

Now, I'll create the GreetingService in the application layer. This service will contain the business logic.

**WriteFile** `Writing to ...rvice/application/GreetingService.java` ←

Now, I'll create a GreetingPort interface in the domain layer. This will define the contract for the greeting service.

**WriteFile** `Writing to ...omain/GreetingPort.java` ←

Now I will modify the GreetingService to implement the GreetingPort interface.

**ReadFile** `...rvice/application/GreetingService.java`

Okay, I will now update the GreetingService.java file to implement the GreetingPort interface.

**Edit** `...rvice/application/GreetingService.java: package hu.vibe.homework.hello.application;... => package hu.vibe.homework.hello...` ←

Finally, I'll update the GreetingResource to use the GreetingPort interface instead of the concrete GreetingService implementation. This will decouple the infrastructure layer from the application layer.

**Edit** `...hello-service//GreetingResource.java: package hu.vibe.homework.hello... => package hu.vibe.homework.hello...` ←

The "Hello World" microservice has been created and structured using Hexagonal Architecture.


To summarize:
- The domain layer contains the GreetingPort interface, which defines the application's core logic.
- The application layer contains the GreetingService which implements the GreetingPort.
- The infrastructure layer contains the GreetingResource, which exposes the service as a REST endpoint.

Now, I'll run the service in development mode.

**Shell** `./gradlew quarkusDev [in hello-service] (Running the Quarkus application in development mode.)` ←

> Nice. Now add something persistence related. Make the service count how many times it was called.

Okay, I'll add persistence to count service calls. This involves creating a Greeting entity and repository, updating the GreetingService to use them, adding Quarkus persistence dependencies to build.gradle, configuring an H2 in-memory database, and finally, updating the GreetingResource to display the count. I'll begin by reading the build.gradle file.

**ReadFile** `hello-service/build.gradle`

I'll add the necessary dependencies for persistence. Specifically, I'll add quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache and quarkus-jdbc-h2. I'll also add quarkus-hibernate-validator to ensure data integrity.

**Edit** `hello-service/build.gradle: dependencies {...} => dependencies {...` ←

Now, I'll configure the H2 in-memory database in application.properties.

**WriteFile** `Writing to ...rvice/resources/application.properties` ← 

Now I'll create the Greeting entity in the domain layer. This entity will represent a greeting and store the number of times it has been called.

**WriteFile** `Writing to ...llo-service/hello/domain/Greeting.java` ←

Next, I'll create a GreetingRepository interface in the domain layer. This will define the contract for persisting and retrieving Greeting entities. I'll use the Panache repository pattern provided by Quarkus.

**WriteFile** `Writing to ...service/domain/GreetingRepository.java` ←

Now I'll create the Panache repository implementation in the infrastructure layer.

**WriteFile** `Writing to ...vice/infrastructure/GreetingRepositoryImpl.java` ←

Now I'll update the GreetingService to use the GreetingRepository. It will create a new Greeting if one doesn't exist, or increment the call count of an existing one. I'll also modify the getGreeting method to return the call count.

First, I'll read the existing GreetingService.

**ReadFile** `...vice/application/GreetingService.java`

Okay, I will now update the GreetingService.java file to use the GreetingRepository and manage the call count.

**Edit** `...vice/application/GreetingService.java: package hu.vibe.homework.hello.application;... => package hu.vibe.homework.hello...` ←

I've implemented the persistence logic. Now, I'll run the application in development mode to verify the changes.

**Shell** `./gradlew quarkusDev [in hello-service] (Running the Quarkus application in development mode.)` ←
