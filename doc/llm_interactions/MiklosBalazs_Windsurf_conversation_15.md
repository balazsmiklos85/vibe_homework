In some places the code seems a bit messy. It would be better if it used a unified code style. Add the Spotless plugin to Gradle.

The plan will be updated to mark the Spotless plugin addition and configuration as complete, and to note that Spotless was applied successfully. The current goal will be updated to reflect that the integration should be verified if needed.

I have added and configured the Spotless plugin in your root 
build.gradle
 file to enforce a unified code style across all subprojects. The configuration uses Google's Java format and targets all Java source files. I then ran ./gradlew spotlessApply, which successfully formatted your codebase according to these rules.

Summary of Changes:

Added the Spotless plugin to the root Gradle build.
Configured Spotless for all subprojects to use googleJavaFormat.
Applied formatting to your codebase.
Your code should now follow a consistent style. If you wish to adjust the formatting rules or add additional formatting steps (for other languages or file types), just let me know!

> I'd prefer to use the Palantir style.

The user requested to switch from Google's Java format to the Palantir style for code formatting. I will update the plan to reflect this new requirement and add a step to update the Spotless configuration accordingly.

Updating the plan to note the preference for Palantir style and to add a new task for updating Spotless configuration and reapplying formatting.

The Spotless configuration has been updated to use the Palantir Java format style, as you requested. I have reapplied formatting across the codebase using this style, and the process completed successfully.

Summary of actions:

Switched Spotless from Google Java Format to Palantir style.
Reformatted all Java files in the project with the Palantir style.
Your codebase now follows the Palantir code style. If you have further preferences or want to tune the formatting, let me know!

> Tbh ny greatest concern with the code was that in lot of places it doesn't use imports, but explicitly adds the classes with their full package path, e.g. `hu.vibe.homework.hello.domain.OrderStatus`. Spotless doesn't seem to fix those. How could I fix them?

You're correct: Spotless (and most code formatters) do not automatically convert fully qualified class names to use imports—they only format code style, not organize imports or refactor usages.

How to Fix Fully Qualified Class Names (FQCNs):

IDE Support (Recommended):
Most modern IDEs (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) have "Optimize Imports" or "Organize Imports" features. These can:
Replace FQCNs in code with simple class names and add the appropriate import statements.
Remove unused imports.
In IntelliJ IDEA:
Select the code or file(s), then use Ctrl+Alt+O (Optimize Imports).
For the whole project: Right-click the project → "Optimize Imports".
You can also enable "Add unambiguous imports on the fly" in settings.
In Eclipse:
Use Ctrl+Shift+O (Organize Imports).
Automated Refactoring Tools:
Tools like OpenRewrite or Google Java Format with import ordering can sometimes help, but most focus on formatting, not refactoring FQCNs.
There are scripts and static analysis tools, but they are less reliable than IDEs for this specific transformation.
Manual Refactoring:
If you don't want to use an IDE, you would need to manually:
Add the correct import at the top.
Replace all usages of the FQCN with the simple class name.
Remove any now-unused imports.
Summary:
The fastest and safest way is to use your IDE's "Optimize Imports" feature. This will clean up FQCNs throughout your codebase in seconds.

If you want, I can guide you on using these features in your specific IDE, or help you write a script for batch replacement (though IDE support is much more robust and less error-prone). Would you like IDE-specific instructions or a script-based approach?
