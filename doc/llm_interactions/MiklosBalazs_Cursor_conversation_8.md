> I have a multi-module Gradle project using Quarkus, that I can't build. What is the issue?

To diagnose why your multi-module Gradle Quarkus project won't build, I'll need to check for common issues such as:
Incorrect or missing module references in settings.gradle
Problems in the root or submodule build.gradle files
Missing or misconfigured dependencies between modules
Deleted or missing source files that are still referenced
From your git status, I see:
Several files in src/main/java/hu/vibe/homework/hello/infrastructure/ have been deleted, but the infrastructure/ directory exists elsewhere (likely moved or restructured).
Both build.gradle and settings.gradle have been modified.
Let's start by:
Checking your settings.gradle for included modules.
Reviewing the root build.gradle for project/module configuration.
Looking for references to the deleted files or misconfigurations.
I'll begin by reading the relevant parts of settings.gradle and the root build.gradle.

Here's what I found from your configuration:
settings.gradle
You include three modules: domain, application, and infrastructure.
build.gradle (root)
The root project depends on :infrastructure and includes Quarkus and related dependencies.
Java 21 is set as the source/target.
No obvious syntax errors.
Potential Issues:
Deleted Files: Your git status shows that several files in src/main/java/hu/vibe/homework/hello/infrastructure/ have been deleted, but the infrastructure module is still included and referenced as a dependency. If these files are required for compilation, their absence will cause build failures.
Module Structure: The infrastructure/ directory exists at the project root, but the deleted files were in src/main/java/.... If the new infrastructure/ module is missing source files or has an incorrect structure, the build will fail.
Dependency Direction: The root project depends on :infrastructure, but typically, the root project is just an aggregator, and dependencies are managed in submodules.
Next Steps:
Check if the infrastructure module's build.gradle is present and correctly configured.
Check if the deleted files are referenced anywhere (e.g., in the infrastructure module or elsewhere).
Check for errors when you run the build (e.g., ./gradlew build). The error message will be very helpful.
Could you please provide the exact error message you get when you try to build? This will help pinpoint the issue. If you want, I can also check the infrastructure/build.gradle and its source structure for further clues.

> ```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Could not determine the dependencies of task ':quarkusGenerateAppModel'.
> Could not resolve all artifacts for configuration ':quarkusProdBaseRuntimeClasspathConfiguration'.
   > Could not find io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive:.
     Required by:
         root project : > project :infrastructure
```

The error message:
Apply to settings.gra...
means that the infrastructure module is declaring a dependency on io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive without specifying a version. This usually happens when the Quarkus platform BOM (Bill of Materials) is not properly imported, or the dependency is declared without a version and no platform is enforcing it.
Key points:
The dependency io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive is missing a version.
The Quarkus BOM should provide the version, but only if it is correctly imported in the submodule's build.gradle.
Likely Causes
Missing or incorrect enforcedPlatform in infrastructure/build.gradle:
Each Quarkus module (not just the root) must import the Quarkus BOM using enforcedPlatform in its dependencies block.
Dependency declared without a version and no BOM present:
If you declare implementation 'io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive' without a version and without the BOM, Gradle cannot resolve the version.
How to Fix
Check your infrastructure/build.gradle and ensure it contains:
Apply to settings.gra...
The enforcedPlatform line must come before any Quarkus dependencies.
If you use variables like ${quarkusPlatformGroupId} etc., make sure they are defined in your gradle.properties or elsewhere.
Would you like me to check your infrastructure/build.gradle and suggest the exact fix? If so, I can read and review it for you.
