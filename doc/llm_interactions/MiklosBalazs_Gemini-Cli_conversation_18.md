> I can create orders, but I can't create their status. I'd need a new endpoint for that.

✦ Okay, I'll add a new endpoint to update the order status. Here's my plan:


   1. Domain Layer: I'll create a new UpdateOrderStatusUseCase interface.
   2. Application Layer: I'll implement the use case with an UpdateOrderStatusService.
   3. Infrastructure Layer: I'll expose a new PATCH endpoint in the OrderResource to handle the status updates.


  I'll start by examining the existing Order and OrderStatus domain objects to ensure I model the changes correctly.

**ReadManyFiles** `Will attempt to read and concatenate files using patterns: ``domain/src/main/java/hu/vibe/homework/order/domain/Order.java``,…`

✦ Okay, I see the Order and OrderStatus structure.


  First, I'll create the UpdateOrderStatusUseCase interface in the domain layer. This will define the contract for updating an order's
  status, taking an order ID and the new status.

**ReadFile** `..main/order/domain/OrderRepository.java`

✦ Got it. OrderRepository has findOrderById and save. Now, creating UpdateOrderStatusUseCase.java.

**WriteFile** `Writing to ...domain//UpdateOrderStatusUseCase.java`

✦ Okay, UpdateOrderStatusUseCase is done. Now for UpdateOrderStatusService. I'll implement the use case, inject OrderPort like the other
  services, find the order, update its status, and save it. First, I'll check GetOrderService.java and OrderPort.java for DI patterns.

**ReadManyFiles** `Will attempt to read and concatenate files using patterns: ``application/src/main/java/hu/vibe/homework/order/application/Ge…`

✦ public interface OrderPort extends OrderRepository {}



  Okay, I'll create UpdateOrderStatusService.java. It will use OrderRepository to find an order by its ID. If found, it will create a new
  Order with the updated status and save it. If not found, it will throw an exception. I'm writing the file now.

**WriteFile** `Writing to ...application//UpdateOrderStatusService.java`

✦ Service created. Now, to the OrderResource. I'll read OrderResource.java, then add a PATCH endpoint. It'll take the order ID from the path
  and the new status from a new DTO in the request body.

**ReadFile** `...ture/infrastructure/OrderResource.java`

✦ Okay, I'll add a PATCH endpoint at /orders/{id}/status to update order status. I'll create a new DTO, UpdateOrderStatusRequest, as a record
  with a single status string field. I'm creating the DTO file now.

**WriteFile** `Writing to ...../dto/UpdateOrderStatusRequest.java`

✦ Typo in path. Correcting to vibe_homework and recreating the file.

**WriteFile** `Writing to ...ture/dto/UpdateOrderStatusRequest.java`

✦ Okay, I'll update OrderResource. I'll inject UpdateOrderStatusUseCase, then add a PATCH method, updateOrderStatus. This method will take an
  id and UpdateOrderStatusRequest, call the use case, and handle any resulting exceptions. Time to code.

**ReadFile** `...ture/infrastructure/OrderResource.java`

✦ Okay, modifying OrderResource.java to add the new endpoint.

**Edit** `...ture/infrastructure/OrderResource.java: import hu.vibe.homework.order.... => import hu.vibe.homework.order....`

✦ I've added the new endpoint and its components to OrderResource.java. Now, I'll create UpdateOrderStatusServiceTest.java in the application
  test directory, using CreateOrderServiceTest.java as a template.

**ReadFile** `...test/application/UpdateOrderStatusServiceTest.java`

✦ Okay, I'm creating UpdateOrderStatusServiceTest.java. It will mock OrderRepository, instantiate UpdateOrderStatusService, and test two
  scenarios: first, that updateOrderStatus correctly saves an updated order when it exists, and second, that it throws an
  IllegalArgumentException when the order is not found. I'm writing the file now.

**WriteFile** `Writing to ...test/application/UpdateOrderStatusServiceTest.java`

✦ Okay, I've tested the service. Now for the endpoint. I'll add an integration test to OrderResourceIT.java, but first, I need to read it.

**ReadFile** `...test/infrastructure/OrderResourceIT.java`

✦ Okay, I'll add a new test to OrderResourceIT.java. It will create an order, update its status via the new endpoint, then fetch the order to
  confirm the status was updated. I'll add this as a new test method to the file.

**ReadFile** `...test/infrastructure/OrderResourceIT.java`

✦ Okay, I'll add a test method to OrderResourceIT.java for the status update.

**Edit** `...infrastructure//OrderResourceIT.java:     } =>     }...`

✦ Integration test added. I think I'm done. I've created the use case, service, DTO, and endpoint, plus unit and integration tests. Now, I'll
  run the tests.

**Shell** `./gradlew test (Running the test suite to ensure that all tests pass.)`

✦ OrderResourceTest.java is failing because I added a new dependency to the OrderResource constructor. I'll read the test, add the missing
  dependency, and rerun the tests.

**ReadFile** `...test/infrastructure/OrderResourceTest.java`

✦ Okay, update OrderResourceTest.java. Mock UpdateOrderStatusUseCase, pass it to the OrderResource constructor, and add a test for the
  updateOrderStatus method.

**Edit** `...test/infrastructure/OrderResourceTest.java:     private OrderResource reso... =>     private UpdateOrderStatusU...`

✦ Okay, I'm adding two tests to OrderResourceTest.java for the updateOrderStatus method: one for success and one for a missing order. I'll
  append them to the file.

**Edit** `...infrastructure//OrderResourceTest.java:         Response resp = resour... =>         Response resp = resour...`

✦ Updated OrderResourceTest.java with new tests. Running them now to confirm functionality.

**Shell** `./gradlew test (Running the test suite to ensure that all tests pass.)`

✦ Tests passed. Endpoint added and verified. Request complete.
